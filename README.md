# Usage

## Basics

To Use Event management you need to Create an **EventManager**:    

```kotlin
val manager: EventManager<Any>? = EventManager()
```

 You can specify the Schedulers for sending and subscribing to events:    

```kotlin
val manager: EventManager<Any>? = EventManager(EventSchedulers.IO, EventSchedulers.MAIN_THREAD)
```
